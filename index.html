The NuBitsj library is a Java implementation of the Nubits protocol, 
which allows it to maintain a wallet and send/receive transactions 
without needing to do full blockchain validation. It comes with full 
documentation and some example apps showing how to use it. NuBitsj uses a
 central server to download block hashes for verification.<br>

Struggle to keep up with the NuBits forum, going on holiday or just bought you new NuShares?<br>
My datafeed will help you out. As a NuShareholder I will vote&nbsp; for
the motions and custoidal grant which I think are in the Shareholder's
best interest.<br>
Please remember that when you don't vote, you basically vote against any motion or custodial grant!<br>
More information and instructions on how to use&nbsp;my NuBits datafeed in your client can be found <a href="https://discuss.nubits.com/t/cybnates-datafeed-beta/1310">here.</a><br>

<img>In a nutshell: You run a program that places NBT, EUR, USD and BTC orders on an 
exchange with a very small spread. The program will send proofs
 of those orders to a server which in turn pays you interest in the form
 of NuBits.<br>
You can find the instructions to participate <a href="http://cybnate.github.io/index-liquidbits.html">here.</a><br>
You can find the awesome Plunge repository <a href="https://github.com/inuitwallet/plunge">here </a>which provides a nice graphical interface.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Cybnate/NuBits-Abe-explorer">Link to Abe NuBits Explorer repository</a><br>
This software reads the NuBits blockfile, transforms and loads the
data into a database, and presents a web interface similar to Bitcoin
Block Explorer.<br>
A working installation showing the NuBits blockchain can be found <a href="https://svr1.nubitsexplorer.nu/chain/Nubits">here.</a><br>
